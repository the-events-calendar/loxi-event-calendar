Loxi is a fully-hosted events calendar that makes it easy to publish events and display them on your WordPress site. Connect, publish and embed with a shortcode.

== Description ==

[Loxi](https://loxi.io) is an event calendar that can be displayed anywhere. Publish events to a beautiful, responsive calendar and use it anywhere on an unlimited number of sites. This plugin lets you embed your Loxi calendar on any WordPress page or post with a simple shortcode.

Loxi is lovingly handcrafted and maintained by [Modern Tribe](https://tri.be), the creators of [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/). We've applied our many years of experience developing the most widely used WordPress calendar plugin to make a beautiful online calendar that works anywhere.

Loxi takes all of the work out of creating events and is delightfully simple to set up. There's no coding required, no theme conflicts to worry about, it looks like a million bucks right out of the box, AND it works on all devices. Spend less time configuring and more time promoting your events!

= An Online Calendar That Scales With You =


Loxi is a fully-hosted calendar, meaning you never have to worry about overloading your WordPress database. Your Loxi calendar can hold as many events as you need and lets you publish an unlimited number of events. That's right, go ahead and create events freely and let Loxi carry the load while you enjoy the speed and performance of our servers, regardless of how many events you host.

= Your Events are Always Backed Up and Safe =

Your calendar is always online and available to view, even if your site goes down. We actively monitor our servers and back everything up on a regular basis to ensure that your events and data are always secure not matter what happens with your WordPress installation.

= Take Your Events With You Anywhere =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Loxi account to use this plugin? =

Yes, you definitely need to [sign up for a Loxi account](https://www.loxi.io/) to use this plugin. But fear not! You can sign up for a demo account absolutely free and with zero commitment, then upgrade only when you want to. The demo account allows you to test things out as much and as long as you want.

= Shortcode Examples =

The default shortcode to embed your Loxi calendar is: `[loxi calendar="my-awesome-calendar"]`.

Customize the appearance of the calendar with any of the following:

* `calendar`: Your calendar ID (e.g. `my-awesome-calendar` if your calendar URL is `https://my-awesome-calendar.loxi.io`)
* `default-layout`: Accepts `month` or `list`
* `color`: Sets the primary color of the calendar with a hex value (e.g. `#ff9800`)
* `show-search-filter`: Set to `1` to show the keyword search and `0` to hide it
* `show-category-filter`: Set to `1` to show the category filter dropdown and `0` to hide it
* `show-location-filter`: Set to `1` to show the location filter dropdown and `0` to hide it
* `show-view-switcher`: Set to `1` to allow visitors to switch views and `0` to disable it

An orange calendar that displays the month view with the view switcher disabled would be:

`[loxi calendar="my-awesome-calendar" default-layout="month" color="#ff9800" show-view-switcher="0"]`

...where `my-awesome-calendar` is the ID of your calendar or the calendar you want to embed.
